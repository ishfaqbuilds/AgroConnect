# AgroConnect: The Smart Farm To City Network
AgroConnect is a web-based platform that directly connects local farmers (like Abdul Karim from Kumira) with urban buyers (like restaurant owners in Chattogram, e.g., Shahed Alam). The goal is to create a transparent, trust-driven, and efficient digital supply chain that eliminates middlemen, reduces loss, and ensures fair pricing for both sides.
